A system that analyzes one's gait patterns and gives feedback to the user. 

People can use it to receive feedback on their walking patterns, which allows for users to receive information before heading to a health professional. 
It can act as the middle man between the user and a health professional. A major hurdle, and the challenge that took majority of the time, was developing the machine learning model. 

* Due to the extensive time needed to train, test, and validate the model, and the lack of processing power, we were not able to complete the machine learning model. We got over it by being able to simulate the process of the system. It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, AWS, and OpenCV. Potential technologies were the COCO-Wholebody dataset, the MMpose machine learning model, and PyTorch. *
